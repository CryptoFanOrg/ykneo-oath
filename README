YubiKey NEO App: OATH
=====================

This project implement the HMAC-SHA* card functionality used on the
YubiKey NEO device that is sold by Yubico.  Its primary use is to use
the YubiKey NEO to generate OATH HOTP/TOTP one-time-passwords.

Building
--------

It is possible to build the project using proprietary NXP Java Card
tools.  Alternatively, we describe below a process using Ant and the
Java Card Development Kit.

You need to install the Java Card Development Kit version 2.2.2,
download it from:

  http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javasebusiness/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javame-419430.html#java_card_kit-2.2.2-oth-JPR

Unpack it into a new directory called for example "jckit" like this:

  $ mkdir jckit
  $ cd jckit
  $ unzip /path/to/java_card_kit-2_2_2-linux.zip
  $ cd java_card_kit-2_2_2/
  $ unzip java_card_kit-2_2_2-rr-bin-linux-do.zip

Point the ant variable JAVACARD_HOME at the folder
java_card_kit-2_2_2.  The project should now build and run tests by
invoking ant.  For example:

  ant -DJAVACARD_HOME=/home/jas/jckit/java_card_kit-2_2_2/

The cap file for loading on card will be at:

  applet/bin/pkgYkneoOath/javacard/pkgYkneoOath.cap

For loading the applet onto the card first make sure the YubiKey NEO
is in the HID/CCID or CCID mode, using ykpers from the YubiKey
Personalization tool:

  http://code.google.com/p/yubikey-personalization/
  https://github.com/Yubico/yubikey-personalization

For example:

  sudo ykpersonalize -m82

Then install the gpshell tool from Global Platform:

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/globalplatform/

The projects that are needed is the GlobalPlatform Library 6.0.0,
GPShell 1.4.4, and gppcscconnectionplugin 1.1.0.

You need to whitelist the device in /etc/libccid_Info.plist.

When the CAP file has been built and is available in the path shown
above, you may use the gpshell tool to load it:

  $ gpshell gpinstall.txt
